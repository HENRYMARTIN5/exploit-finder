        <p>So you wanna downgrade your Chromebook.</p>
        <p>Well, you're in luck! We have a guide for that!</p>
        <p>First, you need to know what firmware version of ChromeOS you're running. Go to <a href="chrome://version">chrome://version</a> and look for where it says "Firmware Version". Find the part after <code>Google_</code>, that's your firmware version. Remember it, because you'll need it. Common values include Lars and Kindred, Grunt, and Skylake.</a></p>
        <p>Now, you need to get the recovery image for your firmware platform and burn the image to a USB drive (8gb or larger).</p>
        <p>For Lars and Grunt, <a href="https://chrome100.dev/">https://chrome100.dev/</a> has a great collection of images. Just find the version you want from a simple menu, then move down to the next step.</p>
        <p>For Kindred, <a href="https://cros.tech/table/">https://cros.tech/</a> has a very large collection of images. Although a bit harder to use than chrome100, the larger volume of images makes it worth using if your desired image isn't on chrome100.</p>
        <p>Finally, if you just can't find an image anywhere else, you can go directly to the source at <a href="https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/serving-builds?deviceCategory=Chrome%20OS">https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/serving-builds?deviceCategory=Chrome%20OS</a>. Find your firmware platform on the table, then look at the rightmost column for recovery image links.</p>

        <p>Now, you need to burn the image to your USB drive. Go to the Chrome Webstore on a Chromebook (if you have access to adding extensions) or on your own computer/Chromebook. If you're on Windows for this stage, you have to right click on Chrome and select "Run as Administrator" before continuing. Now, click on the extension in the extension in the toolbar. A window will pop up. Select the three dots in the corner, and select "use local image". Unzip the file you downloaded earlier and select the <code>.bin</code> file. Choose the USB drive you want to write to (all of its data will be erased) and start the process. Wait for it to do its thing.</p>

        <p>Now, you need to boot into recovery mode. Press and hold ESC + Shift + Power and release it after a second. Your chromebook will prompt you to insert a recovery media. Plug in your USB drive. Recovery should take 2-7 minutes (tested on Lars and Kindred). Once recovered, unplug your USB drive and your Chromebook will reboot.</p>
